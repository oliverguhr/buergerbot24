# Tax categories (wage tax)

Employees are classified into tax categories for the wage tax deduction. The tax category is particularly important when it comes to determining the wage tax deduction amount. It depends on your marital status and whether the wage tax deduction is for your primary or another employment contract.

The information below will explain which (wage) tax category applies to you. The Amt24 process descriptions will tell you how to switch or change your tax category.

### Tax category I

Applies to employees who are single, living in a registered civil partnership, divorced, widowed or married, unless they fall under tax category II, III or IV.

### Tax category II

Applies to the employees mentioned in tax category I if they are entitled to the single parents allowance.
